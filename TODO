- both of these seem to require LuaLaTeX:
  - It seems that in order to use old style numerals, we should use

        \usepackage{fontspec}
        \setmainfont[Numbers={OldStyle,Proportional}]{Latin Modern Roman}

  - automatic kerning of periods and commas after quotes: http://tex.stackexchange.com/a/202801/4430 (this could be done manually without lualatex).
